# BrainBrief

**Sync Twitter bookmarks & lists to NotebookLM**

> Status: ðŸš§ In Development (v1.0 MVP)

---

## What is BrainBrief?

BrainBrief automatically extracts your Twitter bookmarks and curated lists, then uploads them to Google's NotebookLM so you can query them with AI.

**The Problem:**
- You have 500+ Twitter bookmarks you never read
- You curate Twitter Lists (AI experts, marketing gurus, etc.) but never consume them systematically
- NotebookLM could organize and synthesize all this content, but there's no automatic sync

**The Solution:**
BrainBrief runs in your system tray, syncs your Twitter content on a schedule (daily/weekly/monthly), and uploads it to NotebookLM notebooks organized by list.

---

## Features (v1.0)

- âœ… Extract Twitter bookmarks
- âœ… Extract Twitter Lists (user-selectable)
- âœ… Save locally (organized by date + list name)
- âœ… Upload to NotebookLM (separate notebooks per list)
- âœ… Background scheduling (daily/weekly/monthly)
- âœ… System tray app (Mac menubar / Windows systray)

## Development

### Tech Stack

- **Desktop Framework:** Electron (Chromium + Node.js)
- **Browser Automation:** Playwright (persistent sessions)
- **Database:** SQLite (local-first)
- **Scheduling:** node-schedule (cron)
- **Language:** JavaScript / Node.js

### Why This Stack?

See [Decision 001](../Decisions/001-desktop-vs-web-vs-extension.md) for the full rationale:
- **Desktop over Web:** Zero hosting costs, local-first data
- **Electron over Tauri:** Faster iteration with AI pair programming
- **Playwright over Selenium:** Better persistent session handling
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL:** Zero setup for users

2. Desktop vs Web vs Extension: My Decision Framework
3. Scraping Twitter Bookmarks: First 50 Lines of Code
4. Handling Rate Limiting Without Getting Blocked
5. NotebookLM Integration: Browser Automation Without an API
