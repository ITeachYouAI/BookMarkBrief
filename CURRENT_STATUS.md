## ⚠️ **Implemented But UNTESTED**

### **PDF Links**
- ⚠️ **Status:** Code written, NOT tested
- ⚠️ **What it does:**
  - Extracts PDF URLs from tweet text
  - Should upload to NotebookLM as sources
  - Uses same uploadURL() function as YouTube
- ⚠️ **Issues:**
  - Never verified with real PDF link
  - Unknown if selectors work
  - Unknown if NotebookLM accepts PDF URLs

**Recommendation:** Test when you have a PDF link in bookmarks, or disable until tested.

## ❌ **NOT Implemented**

### **Google Docs Links**
- ❌ **Status:** Not implemented
- **Why:** NotebookLM has native Google Drive integration
- **Workaround:** Users can manually add Google Docs via "Google Workspace" button
- **Future:** Could auto-detect Google Docs URLs and remind user to add via Drive

### **Twitter Native Videos**
- ❌ **Status:** URLs extracted, upload not implemented
- **Why:** 
  - File size limit (200MB)
  - Most Twitter videos exceed limit
  - Download complexity
  - Storage issues
- **Current:** URLs saved in markdown for reference
- **Recommendation:** Skip this feature (not practical)

### **Image Files**
- ❌ **Status:** URLs extracted, upload not implemented
- **Why:**
  - Images are reference/context, not transcribable
  - NotebookLM can't analyze images (text-only)
  - Would just take up source slots
- **Current:** Image URLs in markdown
- **Recommendation:** Keep as URLs (sufficient)

## 🐛 **Known Issues:**

1. **Notebook title rename verification** - Title sets but verification reads empty (cosmetic)
2. **PDF upload untested** - Code exists but never verified
3. **YouTube count stat** - Hardcoded to 0 (need to track in DB)
